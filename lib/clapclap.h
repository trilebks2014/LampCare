// Introduce with clap clap
// Clap clap will have 2 graph left and right, I sended in my folder with name graphclapclap.xml
// I have 2 leftGraph and rightGraph to make sure it was clap clap
// If clap clap 
//    Each leftGraph/rightGraph have not more 5 paragram >0
//    Summurize  of number  leftGraph/rightGraph from 650->1500 : sum2GraphMin ->sum2GraphMax
//    |Top leftGraph - Top rightGraph| <250 : disparityTopGraph
//    The zero between LeftGraph and rightGraph not have more 3 number
//    and finally it look like a double moutain raise up and fall down complety
//So this is my code for that
// switchLeftGraph: notice if save to variable left
